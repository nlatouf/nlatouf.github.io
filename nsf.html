												<h2>NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program</h2>
												<p>The NSF GRFP is an honor to receive - it's also shrouded in mystery. Herein I share some of the tips and tricks I picked up,
													as well as my own thoughts and advice on the process! Please note, these are gathered from a variety of online sources, as well
													as from the George Mason University Office of Fellowships (shoutout to Dr. Megan Bruening for all her help!).

											<h3 id="genoverview">General Overview:</h3>

											<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) is a 
											5 year fellowship program which offers full funding for 3 of those years - however you are still a 
											fellow for the remaining 2 years. It's very difficult to get because there is a large number of applicants 
											across every STEM field, and it can highly depend on what kind of reviewer you get. With so many applications 
											to review, the tiniest thing can make a difference - all this to say that most people don't get it and that's okay! 
											Receiving an NSF GRFP is not the make or break point of your career; most successful scientists did not receive one. 
											As hard as it is, try not to take it personally, and remember - just APPLYING is a huge feat; be proud of yourself 
											for doing so! You can apply twice - once as a senior undergrad, and once as a grad student (either in your first or 
											second year), and you'll be graded on different cycles. This means that you won't be compared to graduate students 
											when you apply as an undergrad, but the second- and first-year grad students are graded against each other. For that 
											reason, you’re usually better off applying in your second year as a grad student rather than the first, so you have 
											more classes and, ideally, research under your belt!</p>
											
											<h3 id="nuts">The Nuts and Bolts:</h3>

											<p>The GRFP requires two statements: a personal background statement (3 pages maximum) and a graduate research 
											statement (2 pages maximum). You will also need 3 letters of recommendation (It's 2 required, 3 recommended 
											technically) and your full (unofficial) transcript. </p>
									
											<h3 id="details">Detailed Info:</h3>
											
											<p>Your personal statement, in my opinion, is your time to shine. This is the place where you can explain who YOU are, 
											and what your story is. Let me be clear: you are under no obligation, nor should you, provide information that makes 
											you uncomfortable. Don’t trauma vomit just because you think you have to. Share only what you are comfortable with, 
											and craft your statement to showcase the aspects of yourself that you are proud of. You do want to figure out if 
											there's anything you need to address in your personal background statement. Is your GPA lower than you want it to be? 
											Did you have a bad semester? Are you lacking research experience, or extracurriculars? You want to take the opportunity 
											to address those things in your personal background statement and say WHY - for example, my GPA was lower than I wanted 
											it to be at the time of applying, so I addressed it head on and explained that I struggled with managing the coursework 
											and my part-time jobs at the same time. Sometimes that won't work depending on the reviewer, but generally reviewers 
											want to see that information, or it will at least give them more context to a situation. Also, determine the most 
											important parts of your application that you want to highlight and repeat those things over and over again. The 
											reviewers are reading HUNDREDS of applications a piece, so they will be skimming. If something is important enough 
											that you want to make sure they see it, repeat it as many times as you naturally can.</p> 
												
												
											<p>Next, the research statement: when you are applying as an undergrad, the actual research you propose is less important 
											than the ability to articulate a thoughtful project that is literature-based and can reasonably be completed in 3 years. 
											When you apply as an undergrad, you’re applying at the same time that you are applying to grad schools; the reviewers 
											know that your plans and research field may change come spring, depending on what acceptances you receive! Don’t fret 
											too much about making sure to stay true to the research proposal. For instance, it’s generally recommended that in the 
											last paragraph you use the space to discuss who you want to conduct the proposed research with, and why. These things 
											will likely change depending on the outcome of applications, but the ability to articulate relevant expertise and 
											mentorship is what they’re looking for! You are being judged against other senior undergrads, who are all in the same 
											position as you.</p>
												
												
											<p>When you are applying as a graduate student, the research proposal matters quite a bit more. It is generally 
											expected that whatever you are proposing will be the foundation of your thesis, since you are applying as a grad 
											student who is aware of the school they attend, the special expertise there, etc. First-year and second-year graduate 
											students are judged against each other for the same pool of grants. Thus, it is generally recommended to wait to apply 
											until you are a second-year grad student - this will give you a chance to complete your core courses, find an advisor 
											and proposed research topic, and get used to your new surroundings. Remember, the GRFP is due in October, so you’re 
											writing it by September at the latest. That means that if you apply as a first-year grad student, you don’t have too 
											much more experience than when you were an undergrad. Compared to a second-year grad student, it is more difficult to 
											compete, especially since they likely have a more firm footing in their path to their thesis. Again, this is advice I 
											have personally received! Each situation is different! For instance, if you completed a post-bacc between undergrad and 
											grad school, that might give you an edge as a first-year grad student applicant. Make the decision that is best for you 
											after discussing with your advisor!</p>
												
												
											<p>Don’t be afraid to give texture to the proposal - bolding sentences, using bulleted lists, providing timelines. When the 
											reviewers are reading multiple blocks of text, it’s easy for information to get lost in the shuffle. By changing the 
											structure, it is eye-catching and ensures a closer look at the information. Lastly, we have all heard the saying that a 
											picture is worth a thousand words. Unless your figure is worth 10,000 words, do not put it in the proposal! You lose a 
											lot of space by including a figure, especially when it needs to be thoroughly explained or it will hurt you in review. 
											Nine times out of ten, you can explain what you need to in words with less space than the figure. To be clear: do 
											whatever you deem best! All of this advice is from personal, anecdotal experiences and advice I received during my process.</p>
												
												
											<p>As far as resources, I used Alex Lang's website (https://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship) wherein he has collected 
											the winning research statements and personal background statements across all disciplines - so you can see the general 
											pattern in a winning application regardless of the field of study! You can also find my completed personal statement, 
											research statement, and received review here, for an easy access example - this way, you can also see what resonated and 
											what didn’t with my reviewers. Remember - I did not end up doing this research project! I work with a completely different 
											advisor now, on completely different research, and that is okay!</p>
											
											<h3 id="timeline">My Recommended Timeline:</h3>


											<p><b>Spring Before Applying:</b> Start to think about who your advisor will be, what your research project will be, who your letter 
											writers will be, and find out if your university has an Office of Fellowships! Many universities have an Office of Fellowships 
											that will host info sessions and workshops about applying to numerous fellowships including the GRFP, and will even read your statements.</p>
												
												
											<p><b>Summer Before Applying:</b> Start laying out an outline of your statements, doing your lit review, and participate in any GRFP 
											info sessions or workshops you find being offered by your university or other locations for free - Do not pay for a workshop! 
											There can never be a guarantee of winning the GRFP, so do not pay out of pocket for a workshop. Also, this is the time to ask your 
											letter writers if they will write you a good letter of recommendation. Notice the emphasis on good! You can also direct your letter 
											writers to emphasize certain parts of your statement - perhaps you have one letter writer that focuses on your outreach work, and 
											another on research, for instance. Make sure that you choose topics you will cover in your statements, and that the letters + your 
											statements form a well-rounded submission packet!</p>
												
												
											<p><b>August:</b> Write out your first drafts of both statements, and give them the first proofread. Find a trusted person to also read the 
											first drafts of your statements - ideally someone in your field but not in your niche; e.g. an exoplanet scientist reading a draft 
											about black holes. The reviewers will be experts in the broad field, but not necessarily your niche, so you need to make sure the 
											statements are easily understood to all!</p>
												
												
											<p><b>September:</b> Start getting as many edits as you can from as many trusted people as possible. This is also when to send your drafts 
											(that have undergone at least two rounds of edits) to your letter writers, so they can begin to craft their letters. Continuously 
											be getting edits and working on the statements! Get your CV up to date, and get your unofficial transcript ready.</p> 
												
												
											<p><b>October - Application Month:</b> Continue to get edits through the first week of the month, and implement them. Then, leave your whole 
											application alone for a week. Do not touch it. Do not look at it. This will allow it to marinate in your head, and when you open it 
											back up a week later, you’ll be able to see it with clearer eyes and make any last minute edits. When you spend so long writing 
											something, you stop seeing the forest for the trees. Taking this time away helps you regain the bigger picture. Also confirm with 
											your letter writers that they are ready to submit their letters, and that they are good letters. Then, submit your application 
											whenever ready! I personally prefer to submit two days before the deadline, so I have time to make a last minute correction if needed, 
											but you do you!</p>
												
												
											<p><b>After applying:</b> Take a breather! Celebrate! You applied to a prestigious fellowship, and that’s AWESOME! Take some time off, and then 
											use your well-honed statements to apply to grad schools (if you wrote these as an undergrad). The selection process takes a while, with 
											winners announced anywhere between the second to last week of March all the way through the first week of April. It varies by year, but 
											it is never later than the first week of April, so you have a chance to reach back out to any schools that rejected you and inform them 
											of your win - sometimes they will let you in if they know you come with funding! You will receive the notification via email, and 
											rejections + acceptances go out simultaneously in the early morning, around 8am EST. </p>

											<h3 id="grad">Grad School Applications (briefly):</h3>
											
											<p>IF you are interested in applying to grad schools, most (like 99%) of the advice you see above also applies to grad school applications. 
											Ideally, you will be using the graduate research statement and personal background statement from the GRFP application to use for your 
											grad school applications, with modifications as the school requests (for instance, change of length, or dividing the statements into 
											multiple parts, or what have you). That's the beauty of applying for the GRFP, you can be done with your grad school applications by the 
											beginning of November and be able to relax earlier and not stress during the holiday season and winter break!
												
												
											The most important part of grad school applications: They. Suck. It is a political mess, and so many times whether or not you get in has 
											nothing to do with you, and everything to do with the school. With funding constantly in flux, and research groups overcrowded, you can 
											be a highly desirable candidate and still not get in anywhere. It may not feel like it at the time, but you will be okay. Anecdotally, 
											I got into only one school during my application cycle, but for a research field I wasn’t interested in. I was already looking at jobs when 
											I won the GRFP which was borne of luck. Different people take different journeys and that is completely okay. Find your support system, and 
											make sure to lean on them through this process, because it is difficult. But you can do this!</p>
